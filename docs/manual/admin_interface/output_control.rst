*Incoming* list shows articles that have arrived to Publisher, but are not yet visible online. In order to get them online, they need to be assigned to the tenant, and route on which article will be attached.

*Published* list is for manipulations with published content. There, one can change route to which article is attached, unpublish article, publish it to addtional tenants etc. This list can also be filtered to narrow down the search.
