Publisher Settings
==================

Publisher is built to work with any News API feed and thus it can be used as frontend solution for, say, Wordpress created content, or custom CMS solution, or just a feed that you subscribe for with some provider.

But if you use Publisher together with Superdesk, then you have **Web Site Management** GUI that integrates seemlesly to the Superdesk environment. From there, you can manage one or many websites (or, more generally, output channels) with as many tenants as you want.
