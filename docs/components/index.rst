Components
==========

.. note::

    This section is based on `Sylius documentation <http://docs.sylius.org>`_.

The Components are a set of decoupled PHP libraries, which are the foundation of the Superdesk WebPublisher project, but they can also be used in other PHP projects which don't rely on the Symfony framework itself.

The goal of these components is to solve the problems related mainly to content publishing, content rendering.
